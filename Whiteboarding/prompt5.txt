Question #5: Array Sorting
  Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms — take the time to read about the following:

  * Quick sort
  * Merge sort
  * Heap sort
  * Insertion sort
  * Bubble sort
  * Selection sort

  You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem — as long as it doesn't use sort().

  Example
  Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]
  Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]




function sortArray(array){
  for (let i = 0; i < array. length; i++) {     // loop to sort array
   for (let j = i + 1; j < array. length; j++) { // loop to check 2nd number is greater than 1st number

     if(array[i] > array[j]){   // if 1st num > 2nd num switch place
       temporary = array[i];    //  temp = 1st num
       array[i] = array[j];     //  1st num = 2nd num                        
       array[j] = temporary;    //  2nd num = 1st num                    
     }
    }                          
  }
  return array;
}



// TEST
  // > sortArray([9, 2, 7, 12]);
  // < [2, 9, 7, 12]



9 2
2 7
2 12

9 7
7 12
9 12
